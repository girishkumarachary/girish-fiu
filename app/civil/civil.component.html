       <u><b>Overview :-</b></u><br>
The Civil Department has firmly stood as one of the colossal pillars of the college, it greatly cares for its students to make them efficient and competent enough in the field of Civil Engineering and their related concerns as professionals. The Department of Civil Engineering at VJIT is established in 2013 and in the very few years of existence has established itself as an inspiring learning center. The Department has continuously upgraded itself in terms of academic performance, research and infrastructure as required by the curriculum and the requirements based on industrial need as a result of which our students have been able to develop potential strengths to meet the professional and personal challenges prevailing and who can serve in all the possible positions of their respective job domains and contribute towards a holistic growth. The Department is transforming to a great extent with the diversity that comes with interfacing with other technology domains. The highly qualified faculty team inspires students to do research and train them to address the societal problems while trying to produce responsible, competent engineers who can take a lead in nation-building.

       <u><b> Head of the Department</b></u><br>
Dr. Pallavi Badry completed Bachelor degree in Civil Engineering from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur and Integrated M.S. Ph. D in Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering from IIIT Hyderabad. Her expertise in research bench-marked with 35 technical papers in indexed journals and in National and International peer-reviewed conferences, taken from her Ph. D work. The research comprised a study in a specialized area of soil-structure interaction of a symmetrical building and in extended research in the same. Since 2016 she guided around 15 undergraduate engineers for their degree project. She has presented a few papers, and delivered invited lectures at conferences at IIT Mumbai, IGC Kochi, etc. to publish her research. She served as a Resource Person for several Faculty Development programs within the state. She delivered invited lectures in several short courses conducted at IIITH, and conducts training for trainee engineers from Govt. of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh on safety and Geotechnical aspects of the design of superstructures in contact with SRKR College of Engineering (Bhimavaram) and CRHRDI. Being a very active and proficient faculty member handles the courses for B. Tech and M. Tech in a very efficient and innovative way. Under her guidance, the students have developed a “Shake Table Model” which has been awarded as the “Best Project” at the NCCE’17.
